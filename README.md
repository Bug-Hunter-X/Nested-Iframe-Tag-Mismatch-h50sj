# Nested Iframe Tag Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML error involving mismatched iframe tags within nested iframes.  The incorrect closing tag causes the browser to misinterpret the structure of the HTML document, leading to rendering problems or unexpected behavior.

## The Bug

The `bug.html` file contains nested iframes with a missing closing tag for one of the inner iframes. This causes the browser to incorrectly parse the HTML, leading to unexpected rendering and potential errors in other elements.
